# spanner
This repository contains the CAD design of a Spanner Size 26, created using [CATIA]. The project demonstrates mechanical design principles, accurate dimensioning, and 3D modeling techniques.
Features
 • Size: 26 mm (across flats)
 • Material assumed: [e.g Carbon Steel / Stainless Steel]
 • Designed using: [CATIA V5]
 • Includes 3D model
 • Ready for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or manufacturing simulations
